# RPGEventer
RPGEventer is a program designed to offer quick pop-up events for any Role Playing games.

The goal of this project is to create a tile-based map creator that can display a set size of map (with multiple levels if needed).  This
map will allow you to put your player characters on the screen.  The dungeon master can then place monsters, traps, puzzles that will
challenge the players as they try to cross it.

Along with the addition of smart monsters with A.I. I  hope to add difficult puzzle interactions, lighting fixes with fog of war, multi
level or area maps, and animations of character attacks.  Allowing the use of checks against agility, perception, etc will be added as well.

One main objective is to make this as modular as possible.  Allowing the use of someones own tiles, puzzle block code, monster attacks and
animations, and etc is crucial for the use of the map beyond my own creativity.
